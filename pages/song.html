<p>Words are flowing out like endless rain into a paper cup<br />
They slither wildly as they slip away across the universe<br />
Pools of sorrow, waves of joy are drifting through my opened mind<br />
Possessing and caressing me</p>

<p>Jai guru deva om Nothing’s gonna change my world<br />
Nothing’s gonna change my world<br />
Nothing’s gonna change my world<br />
Nothing’s gonna change my world</p>

<p>Images of broken light which dance before me like a million
eyes<br />
They call me on and on across the universe<br />
Thoughts meander like a restless wind inside a letterbox<br />
They tumble blindly as they make their way across the universe</p>
