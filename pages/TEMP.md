Words are flowing out like endless rain into a paper cup\
They slither wildly as they slip away across the universe\
Pools of sorrow, waves of joy are drifting through my opened mind\
Possessing and caressing me

Jai guru deva om
Nothing's gonna change my world\
Nothing's gonna change my world\
Nothing's gonna change my world\
Nothing's gonna change my world

Images of broken light which dance before me like a million eyes\
They call me on and on across the universe\
Thoughts meander like a restless wind inside a letterbox\
They tumble blindly as they make their way across the universe
